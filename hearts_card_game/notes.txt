Architecture
    Need a game that knows the rules, probably knows what each player has, and asks players for their move
        Probably want to be able to run a game of all AI players quickly.
        Might want to make the GUI optional?
    Need a player class that can be subclassed to human and AI
    Need a window that can display the current state and get clicks to get the user's move
        Will need to show total points taken, and maybe be able to highlight a card

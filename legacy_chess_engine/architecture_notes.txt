Current architecture

Singletons:
  Board
    Knows aboug pieces

  Game
    Owns players
    Knows about pieces



Potential new architecture

  Game
    Has player names, possibly date/time of game or other metadata like that

    Handles communication with gui?

    Board
      Owns pieces
      Might have a list of piece locations as well, for easy iterating over them

      Easily copyable? 
      move_to(from, to) -> new board

    Has an engine, which can generate lots of other boards as needed to calculate out to a given depth?


  Where should the can_move_to logic live? What is the non-OO way of structuring that?

  Bishop->get_valid_moves(board, square)
  Bishop->can_move_to(board, from, to)



def board::can_move(from, to):
  if not from.occupied()
    return false

  if not from.occupier().can_move_to(board, from, to)
    return false

  return true

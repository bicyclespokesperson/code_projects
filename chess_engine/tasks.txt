This position leads to a strange move for white, possibly related to repetition?
r3kb1r/6p1/4p2p/n4p1P/p2P1Pn1/P5P1/3NN3/R1B1K2R w KQkq - 2 24

Implement draws
  insufficient material? Would this actually affect anything?

Search
  Iterative deepening
    Measure alpha/beta success rate? ID ostensibly speeds up search by improving that
  Transposition table
    Zobrist hashing
  Move ordering
    Moves may need more infomation added to them for move ordering
      MVV/LVA and/or SEE
  Better quiescence search

Implement quiesence search

This article is good, might also want to just look at the source code for the engine

Another good look at move generation

Integrated UCI protocol using
  https://github.com/zd3nik/SenjoUCIAdapter

qperft runs at 170,000,000 nodes/sec on my macbook
Stockfish is somewhere around 120,000,000 nodes/sec (very rough estimate)
Python chess lib is 60,000 nodes/sec
My perft implementation runs at 7,000,000 by comparison

Adding a simple move ordering (sort by victim value - attacker value) Dropped my searched nodes from 3.8M to 1.5M for black's first move after 1. e4

WORST CODE OF ALL TIME
